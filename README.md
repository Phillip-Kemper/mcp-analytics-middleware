A simple way to track and visualize how your MCP server is being used. See which tools are most popular, catch errors early, and understand your server's performance. A small video demo and motivation for this is described here:
- Quick Demo
- Supporting Blog Post

## Features

- üîç Track all tool calls and resource requests
- üìä See performance metrics and error rates
- üåê Web dashboard for live analytics
- üíæ SQLite database for persistent storage

## Quick Start

1. Install the package:
```bash
yarn add mcp-analytics-middleware
```

2. Add it to your MCP server:
```typescript
import { McpAnalytics } from 'mcp-analytics-middleware';

let server = new McpServer({ 
name: 'Sample MCP Server with Analytics',
version: '1.0.0'
});

const analytics = new McpAnalytics('analytics.db');

server = analytics.enhance(server); // override tool and resource function implementation to record usage in sqlite
```

## Live Analytics

Want to see a dashboard for a Tyescript SDK MCP Server making use of this middleware? You can directly provide a live dashboard using

```bash
npx -p mcp-analytics-middleware web-viewer --db-path analytics.db

```
The web dashboard will open at http://localhost:8080 and show you live analytics!

You'll see:
- Total tool calls and resource requests
- Error rates and performance metrics
- Most used tools and slowest operations

## Example Implementations

## Running with Inspector

If you're using the MCP Inspector, just add the analytics flag:

```bash
yarn inspector --analytics --db-path analytics.db
```
